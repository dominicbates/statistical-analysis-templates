# statistical-analysis-templates

This repo is to store a few useful templates for statistical modelling. I 
currently have a few notebooks here outlining how to fit a few models on 
toy problems:
- `templates/linear_regression_bayesian.ipynb`: Bayesian linear regression 
using pymc with some useful plots
- `templates/linear_regression_frequentist.ipynb`: Normal linear 
regression using statsmodels and displaying model fit
- `templaces/logistic_regression_bayesian.ipynb`: Bayesian logistic 
regression 
wth pymc with some useful plots

I also have some useful functions saved in:
- `useful_functions.py`: Contains some functions for e.g. plotting traces 
nicely with confident intervals and nice colours
